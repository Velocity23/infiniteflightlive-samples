## Using the Samples

Samples are made of two main parts.

1. A class or equivalent containing function to interact with the API
2. A sample project

To use the samples, Clone or Download this repository, then open the folder of your project. Each project contains a README with specific instructions on how to set up and use it. As per the license, you are welcome to use these samples in your own projects. Credit is not required, but appreciated.

All samples use Environment Variables to store API Keys and include support `.env` files. See project READMEs for more information.
